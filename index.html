        <h3 class='title'>About Me</h3>
        <p>After five years working as an editor for a publishing company in the UK, I left London to find adventure and a fresh start in New Zealand.</p>
        <p>Since April, I've been teaching myself to code online, using Codecademy.com's Computer Science course and Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp series. Having really enjoyed this entry into the world of software and web development, I'm now keen to pick up a professional role to both improve my knowledge and skills, and contribute to a team producing software with a real-world implementation.</p>
        <p>I am a diligent, organised and quick-to-learn self-starter, with strong communication skills and a keen attention to detail. I enjoy problem solving, working in teams and the satisfaction of a job well done!</p>
        <p>I have an undergraduate degree in English Literature and Language (BA, 2:1) from Oxford University, and A Levels in Fine Art, English and Mathematics. In my spare time, I enjoy playing and watching football, tabletop games, painting and photography.</p>
        <p>I currently live in Auckland and have a WHV valid until March 2021 with have the option to extend to February 2022. My partner is a New Zealand citizen, so can apply for a partner visa should we wish to stay beyond then.</p>
        <p>The core languages, frameworks and libraries I have experience of include:</p>

        <h3 class='title'>My Coding Story</h3>
        <p>I first started coding in March 2019. I'd always been interested in the combination of intellectual challenge, practical implementation and teamwork, as it seemed a fantastic combination of my skills and interests. Talking to friends about their experience working in the industry only piqued my interest further.</p>
        <p>My first step was to start learning on Codecademy. I really enjoyed this introduction to programming languages, and was excited to learn as much as I could – getting up early in the morning before work each day to complete more lessons. Soon I had a basic knowledge of Python 3 and core programming tools, such as git and the command line. I'd also started writing a few fun projects myself.</p>
        <p>Thinking more broadly about how my experience of working in illustrated publishing could pair with software development skills, I decided to give web development a go. At the time Colt Steele had started a Daily Code Challenge on YouTube explaining web development, so I started following each day. However, I picked up concepts quickly and found that the pace of the videos didn't move fast enough to satisfy my desire to learn. I bought a few of his Udemy courses and took it from there.</p>
        <p>For the last six months I've been travelling through the North Island working and exploring, all the while trying to keep up my coding progress. But learning and coding on my own has its drawbacks, and I'm now itching to work and learn with others on projects that can have a real impact. So now, having recently arrived in Auckland, I'm looking for a role that can satisfy that desire!</p>

        <p>YelpCamp is a fully-functional review site, enabling users to sign up and post campsites, as well as comment on other people's uploads. This process taught me the basics of full stack development, looking at both the backend server code, using frameworks (Node.js), libraries (Bootstrap) and databases (MongoDB).</p>
        <p>The initial website only supported image urls, so I implemented an image upload system using Cloudinary. I also added animations, including a loading graphic that runs during the upload process. An admin account is always useful to moderate uploads, so I created a user that could edit and delete posts regardless of who created them. Finally, I adjusted the flash messages so that they showed up on login, as well as just sign-up and logging out.</p>
        <p>My additions to the app gave me the opportunity to learn about asynchronous javascript functions. I got a large amounts of unhandled promise rejection errors, before realising that while the asynchrousnous functions I'd added all had catches – the code initially used as part of the code-along didn't!</p>

        <a href="https://tobyjack27.github.io/ColourGame/"><img class='image image-shadow' src='assets/images/colourgame.png'></a>
        <ul class="keywords codelink">

        </ul>
        <p>The aim of this project was to make a simple game, in which players would have to choose the colour that matched the RGB code given in the header. The original game could be made harder or easier by increasing or reducing the number of tiles to choose from.</p>
        <p>To improve the game I adjusted the difficulty system. Realising that the diffculty came in how similar the colours were, rather than the number of them, I rewrote the colour generation function so that squares were more or less similar depending on whether the game was in 'hard' or 'easy' mode. The original script simply picked colours by randomly generating an RGB code.</p>
        <p>I achieved this by regulating how the rgb code for each square was generated. The different modes are based around the principle of dividing 255 (the maximum value for an rgb colour) into segments and then generating each rgb code from within one of these segments. For easy mode, the programme generates an array containing numbers 1 to 18 in a random order. Each new rgb value is created from the first number popped off the random array. i.e. If the first number in the array is 1, the first rgb value will be between 0 and 14, if the second number popped off is then 18, the next rgb value will be between 241 and 255. This means each value is from a different segment of 255 and the colours produced have varying hue, saturation and brightness.</p>          
        <p>For the hard mode, the programme divides 255 into four segments and creates an array containing three of the numbers zero to three in a random order. Each colour value is then generated from the order of those segments. For example, a random array of [2, 1, 4] would generate colours in the range rgb(64–127, 0–63, 193–255). This will produce colours that are more similar.</p>
        <p>I wanted to keep the option of playing with either three or six squares, so I added buttons to control the number of squares that would appear.</p>

        <p>This was the first programme I wrote by myself. I decided I wanted to use my newfound python skills to produce a terminal app that would give you the result of a dice roll (I actually wrote the initial code on iOS notes using my phone). You can select any number of dice (more than zero that is) and you will receive a line of text telling you your results.</p>
        <p>Having got the core input and output functionality working, I spent a fair amount of time thinking of ways that someone could break the programme, and added in catches to prevent user input error. This included someone trying to roll less than one die, or inputting letters rather than numbers. Negative numbers would be converted to their positive equivalent (-1 => 1) and words would throw an input error.</p>

        <p>This sun and sky animation was a simple introduction to keyframes. One of the hardest aspects of this piece of coding was trying to make it fit into a smaller part of a responsive web page! In the end I settled for creating an animation of a fixed size and at the screen size it became too big for the page, I added an image that linked to the full version of the animation on a separate page. You can access that page whatever sized window you are viewing this text from, as the link in the title above will take you there!</p>
